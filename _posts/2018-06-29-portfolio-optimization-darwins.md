We will use the Risk Parity ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_parity)) approach to allocate our assets.

From the link above:

> Roughly speaking, the approach of building a risk parity portfolio is similar to creating a minimum-variance portfolio subject to the constraint that each asset contributes equally to the portfolio overall volatility.

## Strategy

1. The darwins are selected using the approach described in the [previous post]({% post_url 2018-06-29-filters-select-darwins%})
2. Assets weights are calculate using the Risk Parity method with 1 year lookback
3. Rebalance the portfolio each month

## Visualizing

The behaviour of the portfolio allocation since Jun 2017 was:

![img](/assets/images/20180630115200.png)

Stats|Portfolio Risk/Parity Allocation|Portfolio Equal Allocation
Total Return|31.01%|29.36%
Max Drawdown|-4.89%|-5.82%

As we can see, a portfolio with equal assets allocation would get similar results. However, as exercise, this strategy will be followed during 6 months.

Of course we were cheating in these examples, since we were looking back into the past and building portfolios knowing the future.
